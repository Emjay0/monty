0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.
The mandatory task includes
0. push, pall
Implement the push and pall opcodes
1. pint
Implement the pint opcode.
The opcode pint prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line
2. pop
Implement the pop opcode
The opcode pop removes the top element of the stack
3. swap
Implement the swap opcode
The opcode swap swaps the top two elements of the stack
4. add 
Implement the add opcode
The opcode add adds the top two elements of the stack
5. nop
Implement the nop opcode
The opcode nop doesnâ€™t do anything
